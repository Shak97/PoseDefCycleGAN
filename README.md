# PoseDefCycleGAN
**Identity-Preserving Face Frontalization with Deformable Convolutions and Pose-Aware Supervision**


## Overview
Face recognition systems have achieved remarkable accuracy in controlled environments but still struggle under extreme pose variations.  
**PoseDefCycleGAN** addresses this challenge with a novel **face frontalization framework** that integrates the strengths of **cycle-consistency**, **deformable convolution**, and **pose-guided supervision**.


This repository accompanies the paper:

## Code Availability
The **full implementation**, including:
- Training and inference scripts  
- Pre-trained model weights  
- Evaluation tools and dataset preparation guidelines  

will be **made publicly available soon** upon final acceptance of the paper.
